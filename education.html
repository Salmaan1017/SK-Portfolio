            <p>
            I have worked for I&Z, as they needed a website for their company. 
            I took the challenge and did what was needed. 
            I'm very grateful for getting the opportunity to experience how IT work really feels (working for a company). 
            I've developed web applications using multiple software engines (e.g., JavaScript) to create websites that are responsive and user friendly.
            I benefited so much in this participation, I really enjoyed the experience!

        <p>• Hello fellow user. 
            <p>• I'm Salmaan Kazie, I am 19 years of age, and I give you a warm welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                <p>• I have studied Software Development (IT) for about a year, as I am passionate about this course.</p>     
                    <p>• I personally enjoy this module, as it brings me a challenge and joy.</p>    
        
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
            From a young age, I have always been interested in the world of computers. 
            At the age of 16, my passion for IT has grown, however I was facing problems with my school as they didn't serve IT/Computer Science as a subject. 
            This made things much tougher for me, however I was dedicated enough to learn about It myself (self- study). 
            My educational journey has been centered around acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to master this module. 
            I may not be the best, but I'm proud of myself for learning this challenging field so efficiently and effectively. 
            Now that I've been approved by CTU, I have delved into programming, network administration, cybersecurity, and AI & Machine Learning. 
            However, I have yet to understand the underlying mechanisms that power the digital realm. 
            This was my short backstory of this amazing field of work.</p>

        <h2>Why I Love Programming Foundation</h2>
        <p>• Ever since I was young, I've always had an interest in Computers.</p> 
            <p>• A lot of people asked me for help when they were facing issues on their devices, and I was always ready to take the challenge.</p> 
                <p>• I have always wanted a field that could challenge me (but still enjoy it).</p> 
                    <p>• Now that I'm learning the backend of programming, it makes it 10x more interesting.</p>
                        <p>• This is why I've always had a passion for this qualification!</p>
